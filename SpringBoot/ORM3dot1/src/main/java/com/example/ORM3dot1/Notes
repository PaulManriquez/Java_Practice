=== TABLES
Notes:
1.- Identify who is your dominant entity, who is who can hold
    other entities, based on this,
    a university can hold MANY STUDENTS
    , So in university,
    you do not need a foreign key pointing  to Student table

    ONE side (NO FOREIGN KEY)
    N   side (FOREIGN KEY)

CREATE TABLE university (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Table for Student
CREATE TABLE student (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    university_id BIGINT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_student_university FOREIGN KEY (university_id)
        REFERENCES university(id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
